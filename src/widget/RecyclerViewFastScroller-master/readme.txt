RecyclerViewFastScroller

The RecyclerViewFastScroller is a widget that can be added to a layout and connected to a RecyclerView for fast scrolling.

This project is a demonstration of using the RecyclerViewFastScroller widget in a simple activity that uses the basic workings of com.example.android.recyclerview from the v21 Android samples.
